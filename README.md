# Nested Dirichlet models for unsupervised attack pattern detection in honeypot data

This repository contains a _Python_ library supporting the paper *Sanna Passino, F., Mantziou A., Ghani, D., Thiede, P., Bevington, R. and Heard, N. A. (2023) "Nested Dirichlet models for unsupervised attack pattern detection in honeypot data"*, available as a preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02505). 

The library `ncbc` can be installed in edit mode as follows:
```
pip3 install -e lib/
```
The library can then be imported in any _Python_ session:
```python3
import ncbc
```

A demo on how to use the library can be found in `notebooks/test_library.ipynb`.
